/*

ideas for rule interfaces

visual one would be cool but it still is a lot to look at

what if this is where a language interface should start? API for settings rules
logical inference of what rules to set based on symbolic (english) instructions

e.g. "if up is on, output is on" --> look at every up-bit (2nd bit) and set appropriately
some logic is implied, like the converse/contrapositive? "if up is off (not on), output if off"
no, the inverse
if p then q
if !p then !q

other rules can be given more abstract names, like Sierpinski, just 4 bits on
they can also be named by the number they create, a 128-bit number...

---

it might be nice to have something like a search
describe the rule by which bits you want on
